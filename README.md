# Automate certification process by utilizing DCI to interact with the certification portal backend
This repository provides an automated certification process for container projects, along with their automatic publication. It encompasses both new container certification and new release recertification by leveraging offered by DCI. It also includes a procedure of Openshift-cnf certification project auto creation for Vendor Validation and CNF certification.
The process for certifying a new container involves creating a container project, adding or modifying mandatory project parameters, testing and scanning container images, attaching container projects to a product listing, and auto publishing container projects once all requirements are fulfilled.
The process for recertifying existing container projects involves retesting and rescanning new release container images, updating the containerâ€™s version, its digest and tag, and republishing to the catalog.

Finally, a streamlined approach has been implemented, combining Vendor Validation) and CNF certification tasks into a single openshift cnf project workflow. Under this new process, Vendor Validation must be completed and published before the CNF certification task is initiated, which is optional and dependent on the Vendor Validation results. This has been automated into DCI job as well.


 
 
## Prerequisites

- Set up a jumphost with internet access, install the DCI app agent, detailed guide can be found in this link
- It is recommended consistently check latest version of the DCI app agent package, and upgrade to latest version if it not before to use
$ sudo dnf upgrade --refresh --repo dci -y
- If the upgrade or re-installation of the latest DCI repository is not functioning correctly, try using the "install-dci-packages" method provided in the following link above
	
$ sudo dnf remove dci-openshift-app-agent -y
	$ sudo dnf install dci-openshift-app-agent -y
- DCI Control server credential create remote-ci credentials
- Prepare settings.yml for container and CNF projects information
The details of each container certification project type are shown on next sections
- Set auto-publish parameter to ON under container project settings tab (connect.redhat.com)


- DCI Control server credential
  [create remote-ci credentials](https://www.distributed-ci.io/remotecis)
- Prepare settings.yml for container and CNF projects information  
  The details of each container certification project type are shown on next sections
- Set `auto-publish` parameter to `on` under container project settings tab

## Automation Container Certification Flow
![Automation Container Cert Workflow](img/automation-container-certification-flow.png)

### Auto Publish Preparations

- OCP and DCI ENV (included dcirc.sh,install.yml etc..)
Any OCP Cluster and a helper node with DCI RPM packages installed
- Settings.yml
A Settings with DCI auto-publish enhancement feature
- Auth.json
Docker Authentication file to access OCI compatible container repo on partner private registry.
Here is a example of using quay.io registry and run podman/docker on your jumphost and linux machine , 
   - Login to your private registry server
   
    ``` 
    $ podman login -u testuser quay.io
    ```
   - use echo command to locate your auth.json file for your private registry:
      ```
      $ echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
	        /run/user/4205315/containers/auth.json
      ```  
more info can be found this link
If you are using other OCI compatible container repository, just get auth.json ready for tool to use
- Pyxis-apikey.txt
A token to access specific partner portal( connect.redhat.com) Pyxis  data using REST API. Create Pyxis API Key 
- Kubeconfig
A kubeconfig that is used to access the OCP cluster on which CNF with all its artifacts will either be deployed or has already been deployed for CNF certification test
- Product-listing ID
Before a container or helm chart/operator can be publicly listed into RedHat catalog, a Product-Listing must be created, it only needs to be created once according to CNF type. Follow this link to [Create-Product-Listing](https://connect.redhat.com/manage/products)
- Organization ID
Mandatory when using create_container_project. Company ID will be used for the verification of the container certification project Organization-ID Company-Profile. 


Login to your private registry server:
```shellSession
$ podman login -u testuser quay.io
$ echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
/run/user/4205315/containers/auth.json
```

## Recertify Certification Container Projects
In the auto-publish process, we have seen the effectiveness of using DCI to communicate with the catalog backend, which enables full end-to-end automation for container certification.

In the next recertification process, we can use a similar approach to recertify a new release of a certified container under an existing project. DCI is also able to recertify certification projects that are already active and published with a new release version and tag.

- Identify the certification projects that need to be recertified  
- Update the certification project's release version and tag to the new release version and tag  
- Run DCI to embed Preflight to retest the container of new release and submit new report to current container project in partner portal  
- Confirm and verify the project information under the project, then publish it to the catalog for completion recertification.  
  
Please note that these are just general steps and may vary depending on the specific project. And also basic and general requirements to run `recertify` the container projects please use follow this [section](https://github.com/ansvu/cnf-certification-automation-with-dci/tree/main#auto-publish-preparations)

### Recertify Settings Configuration
```yaml
---
dci_topic: OCP-4.12
dci_name: Testing DCI to Recertify the certification container projects
dci_configuration: Using DCI to Recertify the Certification container Project
preflight_test_certified_image: true
check_for_existing_projects: true
ignore_project_creation_errors: true
organization_id: 12345678
dci_config_dirs: [/etc/dci-openshift-agent]
partner_creds: "/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/auth.json"
preflight_containers_to_certify:
  - container_image: "quay.io/avu0/auto-publish-ubi8-nginx-demo1:v121"
    create_container_project: true
 
  - container_image: "quay.io/avu0/auto-publish-ubi8-nginx-demo2:v121"
    create_container_project: true

pyxis_apikey_path: "/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/pyxis-apikey.txt"
dci_gits_to_components: []
...
```
As you may have noticed, the create_container_project parameter is now set to true even when recertifying container projects. This is a new change that was recently made. The backend will now reject the creation of a container project if it is already in the active state, but the DCI will ignore this and continue with the recertification process
## E2E Automation Certification Of Operator Bundle Project
This represents a new enhancement to the end-to-end (E2E) certification process for operators in conjunction with DCI. It involves the automation of updates and the attachment of product listings. Tatiana, a member of the DCI team, has authored a blog post that contains specific information about the prerequisites and settings related to this improvement. You can access the blog post by following this link: [end-to-end-certification-of-operators-with-dci](https://blog.distributed-ci.io/preflight-integration-in-dci.html#end-to-end-certification-of-operators-with-dci).

**Note:** The forthcoming section will introduce new changes to the settings, which will be provided in detail. Additionally, there will be a new collaborative blog post with the DCI team, delving into these recent enhancements to DCI certification.

## Automate creation of the Openshift-cnf project for Vendor Validated
This feature automatically generates an OpenShift-CNF certification project when this option `create_cnf_project` set to `true`. The new feature reuses some tasks from the `create-certification-project` role, and the associated templates are stored within this feature. Currently, there are no mandatory parameters that need to be updated in the new feature.

Please note that the feature openshift-cnf is currently a basic automation setup. It will undergo further updates once additional options are available from the backend REST API, such as `{"certification_level":"Certified"}` parameter for starting the Certify the functionality of your CNF on Red Hat OpenShift step within the project.


### Global Variables
As the new role openshift-cnf reuses some existing tasks, please refer to the description in the `create-certification-project` role for information on the shared global variables.


### Variables to define for each cnf_to_certify

Name                     | Default                                                                    | Description

pyxis_apikey_path: "/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/pyxis-apikey.txt"
dci_gits_to_components: []
...
```
**Note:** New and recertified container image projects can be included in the same settings.yml file, but new container certification projects require more detailed descriptions and additional parameters in the cert_setting section. This is so that partners can easily distinguish between new and recertified images.

For recertified container projects, if partners have not yet enabled auto-publish for the projects from the portal Gui, they must manually enable it before using the DCI to automate the certification process.

## Automate Helm Chart Certification Project
This new helm chart feature will automate creating the helm chart certification projects, update mandatory parametes and attach the product-listing with option to set auto-publish on or off.

### Settings For Automate Helm Chart
Note: For this automation to work, both cert_settings and cert_listings are mandatory.

### Helm Chart Deploy and PR Chain Settings
Upon the creation of the Helm chart certification project, we have the option to utilize the chained settings configuration from the preceding section to initiate the deployment of the Helm chart. Subsequently, we can submit a pull request (PR) for merging. It's crucial to note that there are a couple of vital prerequisites in place. Firstly, a pre-test of the Helm chart using the chart-verifier must be conducted to generate a report.yaml file, ensuring the successful completion of all chart-verifier test cases before the merge can proceed. Secondly, it is imperative that the container certification has been published in the catalog and that the corresponding images are available within the catalog as well.

If you want to test helm chart PR without submit to Catalog, then please following this [sandbox-repository](https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/plugins/gitiles/dci-openshift-app-agent/+/35b28a7f30603a17d5567ebc82b2a3e2f8027d34/roles/chart-verifier)

## Run Chart Verifier and TNF Suite Test Together
This section will show to use DCI to run chart-verifier with option `-c` or `--skip-cleanup` so CNF helm chart deploys and leave CNF PODs running then using DCI to test the TNF suite base CNF namespace. 

### Example of chart-verifier and TNF Test Suite Settings Configuration
```yaml
---
dci_topic: OCP-4.11
dci_name: Chart-verifier with TNF Suite testing
dci_configuration: DCI Chart-verifier SampleChart + TNF Suite testing
dci_openshift_app_image: quay.io/testnetworkfunction/cnf-test-partner:latest
do_chart_verifier: true
dci_openshift_app_ns: avachart
do_must_gather: false
check_workload_api: false
partner_name: telcoci SampleChart
partner_email: telco.sample@redhat.com
github_token_path: "/opt/cache/token.txt"
dci_charts:
  - name: testchart13
    chart_file: https://github.com/ansvu/samplechart2/releases/download/samplechart-0.1.3/samplechart-0.1.3.tgz
    #chart_values: https://github.com/ansvu/samplechart2/releases/download/samplechart-0.1.3/values.yaml
    #install: true
    deploy_chart: true
    flags: "-c -W"
    create_pr: false

do_cnf_cert: true
tnf_labels: common,telco,extended
tnf_log_level: trace
tnf_config:
  - namespace: avachart
    targetNameSpaces:
      - avachart
    operators_regexp:
    exclude_connectivity_regexp:
test_network_function_version: v4.2.4
dci_gits_to_components: []
...
```
Note: Some cases where partner wants to deploy CNF and leave it running and do not want to teardown CNF. So with new feature from chart-verifier `1.12.1`, it adds `-c` option to allow users to skip the `cleanup` e.g. `helm uninstall`.

## How to Run DCI Auto-publish, Recertify, Operator, HelmChart and Openshift-cnf Vendor validated
- Login to DCI user  
```shellSession
$ su - dci-openshift-app-agent
```
- Prepare a settings file for different type of certification projects accordingly
  - [Auto Publish New Container Certification Project Settings](https://github.com/ansvu/cnf-certification-automation-with-dci/tree/main#auto-publish-settings-configuration)
  - [Recertify Container Certification Project Settings](https://github.com/ansvu/cnf-certification-automation-with-dci/tree/main#recertify-settings-configuration)
  - [E2E Certification of Operator Bundle Settings](https://github.com/ansvu/cnf-certification-automation-with-dci#e2e-certification-settings-of-operator-bundle)
  - [Automate Helm Chart Certification Settings](https://github.com/ansvu/cnf-certification-automation-with-dci#settings-for-automate-helm-chart)
  - [Openshift-cnf Certification Project Vendor Validated Settings](https://github.com/ansvu/cnf-certification-automation-with-dci/tree/main#example-configuration-of-openshift-cnf-certification-project-creation)
- Export KUBECONFIG  
```shellSession
$ export KUBECONFIG=/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/kubeconfig
```
- Start RUN DCI OpenShift App Agent  
```shellSession
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- -vv
```
## Known Issues

- Must gather log disable

For partners with larger OpenShift clusters and disconnected labs, running DCI for container image automation and recertification can pose challenges. Uploading the must-gather log, which collects OCP logging data, becomes problematic due to its size. This can cause DCI to get stuck for over 2 hours as it retries unsuccessfully through the partner's proxy.

A solution is to disable must-gather log collection, the set `do_must_gather: false` to settings.yml. This allows DCI to proceed without uploading the large logs and avoids proxy-related issues.
